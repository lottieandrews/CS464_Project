# Experimental Design

The aim of this experiment is to determine whether providing a more interactive learning experience
with metaphors will establish better learning outcomes than approaches that are more static in
nature. Based on our research on the subject, our hypothesis is that students who use the interactive 
command line game that we have implemented will score higher on an aptitude test than those who were 
given traditional learning material, thereby suggesting that students learn better when using interactive 
education software.

We aim to recruit those with little to know knowlede of bash commands for this study. We are
attempting to reach out to CSU students taking entry level CS classes this semester so as to control for
age and level of experience working with computers. This will be a between-subjects study as having those 
who are new at learning bash commands complete two courses on how to use the command line, they will 
likely perform better on the second aptitude test regardless of which they took first as they will 
already have had the exposure. Because of this, we will be aiming to recruit an even number of 
participants that will be assigned to the two learning methods randomly. Our goal is to have 20 
participants for this study however we might have to make do with who we recruit due to COVID-19 restrictions.

The independent variable in this study will be the type of learning method (interactive vs non-interactive)
and the dependent variable will be the scores the students receive on the test following the completion
of the learning material. An ANOVA will be conducted on the results to determine if the type of learning
material had a significant impact on the students' understanding of bash commands. We will also collect
feedback from the participants on how they felt the learning material facilitated in their understanding
of bash commands which will be included in our results. We will evaluate all of this at the end of the 
experiment to determine if our hypothesis was correct, incorrect, or if the study was inconclusive.
