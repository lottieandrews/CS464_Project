**A note about the `assessment` package for feedback purposes:**
The `assessment` package (and the `GroceryList` class) will not actually be used for assessment purposes. The actual assessment we will be using is contained in a Google form we will distribute to all participants. A PDF version of this Google form can be found at `checkpoints/checkpoint3/assessment.pdf`. We ended up using `GroceryList` for testing purposes only and will NOT be using it as a deliverable.
