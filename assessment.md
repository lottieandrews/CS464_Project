## Your Tasks

1. Before we start, let's make sure we're actually reading our grocery list. Type the command that tells you where you are.
2. Great, so we have our grocery list. But what's on it? Type the command that tells you what's in this folder. 
3. Navigate to the `Juice` folder (Hint: it's filed under `Beverages`).
4. Do I like pulp in my orange juice? Search for the word "pulp" inside of the `orangeJuice` file.
5. Where would the `Soda` folder be? Navigate there.
6. Ever wondered what Diet Sprite tastes like? Me neither, but read the file `dietSprite` anyway to find out.
7. We're all done with beverages! Navigate back to `GroceryList`.
8. Where would the `IceCream` folder be? Navigate there.
9. Vanilla ice cream is a classic, but it's not the best. Change `vanilla` to `chocolate`.
11. We're done with animal products, but we're not done with animals. Navigate to the `Meat` folder.
12. Oops! Looks like we forgot to sort one of our list entries. Create a folder called `Poultry`.
13. Now, move `chickenWings` into that folder.
14. That was exhausting! I'm a vegetarian now. Navigate to the `Fruit` folder.
15. The `Berries` folder is empty, and we've got plenty of fruit on our list already. Delete it.
16. Finally, navigate to the `Vegetables` folder.
17. `brusselsSprouts` are gross! Delete them.

Good job, you finished organizing the grocery list! Enter the command `exit` to close the terminal.
