## Tutorial
### `pwd`
The **`pwd`** (print working directory) command tells you where you are within a filesystem. The command returns the user's location within a filesystem represented as an _absolute path_, which shows where the current folder is located relative to the entire system. 

	> pwd
	/Users/guest/Documents/Homework
	
In the example above, `/Users/guest` refers to the user's _home directory_. The user is currently located in the `Homework` folder. `Homework` is inside of the `Documents` folder, which is located in the user's home directory.

#### Command #1
Type the **`pwd`** command to find out your current location within your filesystem. Whenever you are finished typing a command, press the Enter key to execute it. If you have completed the startup instructions correctly, you should be located in of the `Start` folder. Can you identify the name of your home directory?

### `ls`
The **`ls`** (list) command lists the names of all of the files and subfolders inside of the current directory.

#### Command #2
Type the **`ls`** command to see what is contained in the `Start` folder.
