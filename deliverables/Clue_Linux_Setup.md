# Setup Instructions: Learning Option A

For your assigned learning option, you will be playing a text adventure game in the command line and learning terminal commands as you go along.

1. Right-click the `Clue.jar` file, then click **Properties** > **Open With** > **Other Application** > **Terminal**. Depending on the flavor of Linux you're using, you may be able to do this in fewer clicks.
2. Once you have the terminal open, copy and paste the following line of code and hit Enter:
    >  `java -jar Clue.jar`
3. You have now launched the program and can begin the game.    
4. Once you have completed your assigned learning option, you will see a message that says "Congratulations!" and be prompted to exit the terminal. Please exit the program immediately upon completion.
5. Return to the User Survey and complete the remaining sections.
