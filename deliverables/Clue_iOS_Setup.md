# Setup Instructions: Learning Option A

For your assigned learning option, you will be playing a text adventure game in the command line and learning terminal commands as you go along. Please read through these instructions completely before you begin.

1. Double click the file `Clue.command` to launch the program in the terminal. It is likely that you will receive the following error message:

   If you do not receive an error message and the program launches, proceed to step 3.
   
2. Open **System Preferences** > **Security & Privacy** > **General**. Click the button near the bottom right of the window that says "Open Anyway", then click "Open".
3. You have now launched the program and can begin the game.    
4. Once you have completed your assigned learning option, you will see a message that says "Congratulations!" and be prompted to exit the terminal. Please exit the program immediately upon completion.
5. Return to the User Survey and complete the remaining sections.
