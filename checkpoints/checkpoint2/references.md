<br> Study investigating the effect of computer games and visual metaphor on learning and engagement in adult learners. Found that computer games increased engagement but lowered learning levels, and visual metaphor had no effect. However, the combination of both factors resulted in both higher engagement and higher levels of tacit learning.
