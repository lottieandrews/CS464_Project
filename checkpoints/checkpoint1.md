# CS464 Project

## Description
With more and more teaching being done via technology, e-Learning is on the rise. Whether it’s a teacher looking for online materials to supplement their lessons or people who are seeking out whole education programs online via websites like Udemy and Codecademy, there is a high demand for interactive learning software. We propose a project that would create a prototype of an interactive learning application that would teach the user how to execute various beginner terminal functions. While using the terminal is a valuable computer science skill, teaching computer science students how to use it sometimes slips through the cracks, leaving students to have to learn how to use it on their own. This application would attempt to provide a fun and interactive way to learn how to execute some of the most common tasks using the terminal.

## Technology

## Motivation
The demand for interactive learning tools is at an all time high. Now more than ever students and teachers alike are relying on well designed interactive learning software. The motivation behind this project is to determine what makes interactive learning software intuitive and easy to use. When it comes to e-learning, researchers have been studying the effects of various input and output devices to improve upon e-learning applications. Input devices currently being researched include time stamping (determine time delays between user responses and use this to judge the difficulty level of the question or the interest level of the user), three-dimensional pointing and manipulation, facial expression recognition, and voice. Output devices include better graphics resolution, touchable three-dimensional displays, non-speech audio output for ‘visualizing data’, and color (Gawande, Virendra, 2010). The goal of this project will be to implement at least one of these input/output devices and create an experiment around our prototype to determine if the presence of these devices has any meaningful impact on how effective the e-learning software was at teaching the user how to use the terminal.
