# CS464 Project

## Description
With more and more teaching being done via technology, e-Learning is on the rise. Whether it’s a teacher looking for online materials to supplement their lessons or people who are seeking out whole education programs online via websites like Udemy and Codecademy, there is a high demand for interactive learning software. We propose a project that would create a prototype of an interactive learning application that would teach the user how to execute various beginner terminal functions. While using the terminal is a valuable computer science skill, teaching computer science students how to use it sometimes slips through the cracks, leaving students to have to learn how to use it on their own. This application would attempt to provide a fun and interactive way to learn how to execute some of the most common tasks using the terminal.

## Technology

## Motivation
The demand for interactive learning tools is at an all time high. Now more than ever students and teachers alike are relying on well designed interactive learning software. The motivation behind this project is to determine what makes interactive learning software engaging and effective. We will speficially be focusing on creating a murder mystery story to teach people how to use various terminal commands using our interactive software. By linking terminal commands to events like finding a clue or storing evidence, we hope to make a fun and effective teaching tool that increases retention and engagement. Various studies have been conducted on the effects of educational games and simulations on learning. In a study by SRI Education conducted on K-12 grade students, researchers found that students who used simulations as part of their learning process often had a better outcome than those who didn't (SRI Education, 2014). In another study on game-based learning, researchers studied the effects of an educational game adapted from the popular game Minecraft on second year college students. Their results determined that game-based learning increases student motivation and engagement (Cozar, Saez-Lopez, 2016). We believe that by creating a game geared towards teaching terminal skills, we will develop a more engaging and more effective way to learn.
